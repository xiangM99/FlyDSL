"""
Minimal reproducer: variable assigned inside `if tid < threshold`
and used after the if block.

On current main, `scf_if_dispatch` has NO result/yield support,
so the if body is wrapped in a closure. The closure mutates `val`
in its local scope, but the outer scope never sees the update
(Python closure rebinding + MLIR SSA dominance).

Expected: either
  (a) a compile error ("val defined inside branch used outside"), or
  (b) correct scf.if with yield so `val` is properly live-out.

Actual (main): silently uses the PRE-if value of `val` after the if,
producing wrong results.
